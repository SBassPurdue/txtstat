Introduction:  A  GUIDE  TO  THE  GUIDE  
  
Some  unhelpful  remarks  from  the  author    
  
The  history  of  The  Hitchhiker's  Guide  to  the  Galaxy  is  now  so  
complicated  that  every  time  I  tell  it  I  contradict  myself,  and  whenever  
I  do  get  it  right  I'm  misquoted.  So  the  publication  of  this  omnibus  
edition  seemed  like  a  good  opportunity  to  set  the  record  straight  ʹ  or  
at  least  firmly  crooked.  Anything  that  is  put  down  wrong  here  is,  as  far  
as  I'm  concerned,  wrong  for  good.    
The  idea  for  the  title  first  cropped  up  while  I  was  lying  drunk  in  a  
field  in  Innsbruck,  Austria,  in  1971.  Not  particularly  drunk,  just  the  
sort  of  drunk  you  get  when  you  have  a  couple  of  stiff  Gössers  after  
not  having  eaten  for  two  days  straight,  on  account  of  being  a  
penniless  hitchhiker.  We  are  talking  of  a  mild  inability  to  stand  up.    
I  was  traveling  with  a  copy  of  the  Hitch  Hiker  s  Guide  to  Europe  by  
Ken  Walsh,  a  very  battered  copy  that  I  had  borrowed  from  someone.  
In  fact,  since  this  was  1971  and  I  still  have  the  book,  it  must  count  as  
stolen  by  now.  I  didn't  have  a  copy  of  Europe  on  Five  Dollars  a  Day  (as  
it  then  was)  because  I  wasn't  in  that  financial  league.    
Night  was  beginning  to  fall  on  my  field  as  it  spun  lazily  underneath  
me.  I  was  wondering  where  I  could  go  that  was  cheaper  than  
Innsbruck,  revolved  less  and  didn't  do  the  sort  of  things  to  me  that  
Innsbruck  had  done  to  me  that  afternoon.  What  had  happened  was  
this.  I  had  been  walking  through  the  town  trying  to  find  a  particular  
address,  and  being  thoroughly  lost  I  stopped  to  ask  for  directions  
from  a  man  in  the  street.  I  knew  this  mightn't  be  easy  because  I  don't  
speak  German,  but  I  was  still  surprised  to  discover  just  how  much  
difficulty  I  was  having  communicating  with  this  particular  man.  
Gradually  the  truth  dawned  on  me  as  we  struggled  in  vain  to  
understand  each  other  that  of  all  the  people  in  Innsbruck  I  could  have  
stopped  to  ask,  the  one  I  had  picked  did  not  speak  English,  did  not  
speak  French  and  was  also  deaf  and  dumb.  With  a  series  of  sincerely  
apologetic  hand  movements,  I  disentangled  myself,  and  a  few  
minutes  later,  on  another  street,  I  stopped  and  asked  another  man  
who  also  turned  out  to  be  deaf  and  dumb,  which  was  when  I  bought  
the  beers.    
I  ventured  back  onto  the  street.  I  tried  again.    
When  the  third  man  I  spoke  to  turned  out  to  be  deaf  and  dumb  
and  also  blind  I  began  to  feel  a  terrible  weight  settling  on  my  
shoulders;  wherever  I  looked  the  trees  and  buildings  took  on  dark  and  
menacing  aspects.  I  pulled  my  coat  tightly  around  me  and  hurried  
lurching  down  the  street,  whipped  by  a  sudden  gusting  wind.  I  
bumped  into  someone  and  stammered  an  apology,  but  he  was  deaf  
and  dumb  and  unable  to  understand  me.  The  sky  loured.  The  
pavement  seemed  to  tip  and  spin.  If  I  hadn't  happened  then  to  duck  
down  a  side  street  and  pass  a  hotel  where  a  convention  for  the  deaf  
was  being  held,  there  is  every  chance  that  my  mind  would  have  
cracked  completely  and  I  would  have  spent  the  rest  of  my  life  writing  
the  sort  of  books  for  which  Kafka  became  famous  and  dribbling.    
As  it  is  I  went  to  lie  in  a  field,  along  with  my  Hitch  Hiker's  Guide  to  
Europe,  and  when  the  stars  came  out  it  occurred  to  me  that  if  only  
someone  would  write  a  Hitchhiker's  Guide  to  the  Galaxy  as  well,  then  
I  for  one  would  be  off  like  a  shot.  Having  had  this  thought  I  promptly  
fell  asleep  and  forgot  about  it  for  six  years.    
I  went  to  Cambridge  University.  I  took  a  number  of  bathsʹand  a  
degree  in  English.  I  worried  a  lot  about  girls  and  what  had  happened  
to  my  bike.  Later  I  became  a  writer  and  worked  on  a  lot  of  things  that  
were  almost  incredibly  successful  but  in  fact  just  failed  to  see  the  light  
of  day.  Other  writers  will  know  what  I  mean.    
My  pet  project  was  to  write  something  that  would  combine  
comedy  and  science  fiction,  and  it  was  this  obsession  that  drove  me  
into  deep  debt  and  despair.  No  one  was  interested,  except  finally  one  
man  a  BBC  radio  producer  named  Simon  Brett  who  had  had  the  same  
idea,  comedy  and  science  fiction.  Although  Simon  only  produced  the  
first  episode  before  leaving  the  BBC  to  concentrate  on  his  own  writing  
(he  is  best  known  in  the  United  Stares  for  his  excellent  Charles  Paris  
detective  novels),  I  owe  him  an  immense  debt  of  gratitude  for  simply  
getting  the  thing  to  happen  in  the  first  place.  He  was  succeeded  by  
the  legendary  Geoffrey  Perkins.    
In  its  original  form  the  show  was  going  to  be  rather  different.  I  was  
feeling  a  little  disgruntled  with  the  world  at  the  time  and  had  put  
together  about  six  different  plots,  each  of  which  ended  with  the  
destruction  of  the  world  in  a  different  way,  and  for  a  different  reason.  
It  was  to  be  called  "The  Ends  of  the  Earth  "    
While  I  was  filling  in  the  details  of  the  first  plot  ʹ  in  which  the  Earth  
was  demolished  to  make  way  for  a  new  hyperspace  express  route  ʹ  I  
realized  that  I  needed  to  have  someone  from  another  planet  around  
to  tell  the  reader  what  was  going  on,  to  give  the  story  the  context  it  
needed.  So  I  had  to  work  out  who  he  was  and  what  he  was  doing  on  
the  Earth.    
I  decided  to  call  him  Ford  Prefect.  (This  was  a  joke  that  missed  
American  audiences  entirely,  of  course,  since  they  had  never  heard  of  
the  rather  oddly  named  little  car,  and  many  thought  it  was  a  typing  
error  for  Perfect.)  I  explained  in  the  text  that  the  minimal  research  my  
alien  character  had  done  before  arriving  on  this  planet  had  led  him  to  
think  that  this  name  would  be  "nicely  inconspicuous."  He  had  simply  
mistaken  the  dominant  life  form.    
So  how  would  such  a  mistake  arise?  I  remembered  when  I  used  to  
hitchhike  through  Europe  and  would  often  find  that  the  information  
or  advice  that  came  my  way  was  out  of  date  or  misleading  in  some  
way.  Most  of  it,  of  course,  just  came  from  stories  of  other  people's  
travel  experiences.    
At  that  point  the  title  The  Hitchhiker's  Guide  to  the  Galaxy  
suddenly  popped  back  into  my  mind  from  wherever  it  had  been  
hiding  all  this  time.  Ford,  I  decided,  would  be  a  researcher  who  
collected  data  for  the  Guide.  As  soon  as  I  started  to  develop  this  
particular  notion,  it  moved  inexorably  to  the  center  of  the  story,  and  
the  rest,  as  the  creator  of  the  original  Ford  Prefect  would  say,  is  bunk.    
The  story  grew  in  the  most  convoluted  way,  as  many  people  will  be  
surprised  to  learn.  Writing  episodically  meant  that  when  I  finished  
one  episode  I  had  no  idea  about  what  the  next  one  would  contain.  
When,  in  the  twists  and  turns  of  the  plot,  some  event  suddenly  
seemed  to  illuminate  things  that  had  gone  before,  I  was  as  surprised  
as  anyone  else.    
I  think  that  the  BBC's  attitude  toward  the  show  while  it  was  in  
production  was  very  similar  to  that  which  Macbeth  had  toward  
murdering  people  ʹ  initial  doubts,  followed  by  cautious  enthusiasm  
and  then  greater  and  greater  alarm  at  the  sheer  scale  of  the  
undertaking  and  still  no  end  in  sight.  Reports  that  Geoffrey  and  I  and  
the  sound  engineers  were  buried  in  a  subterranean  studio  for  weeks  
on  end,  taking  as  long  to  produce  a  single  sound  effect  as  other  
people  took  to  produce  an  entire  series  (and  stealing  everybody  else's  
studio  time  in  which  to  do  so),  were  all  vigorously  denied  but  
absolutely  true.    
The  budget  of  the  series  escalated  to  the  point  that  it  could  have  
practically  paid  for  a  few  seconds  of  Dallas.  If  the  show  hadn't  
worked...    
The  first  episode  went  out  on  BBC  Radio  4  at  10  30  P.M.  on  
Wednesday,  March  8,  1978,  in  a  huge  blaze  of  no  publicity  at  all.  Bats  
heard  it.  The  odd  dog  barked.    
After  a  couple  of  weeks  a  letter  or  two  trickled  in.  So  ʹ  someone  
out  there  had  listened.  People  I  Balked  to  seemed  to  like  Marvin  the  
Paranoid  Android,  whom  I  had  written  in  as  a  one  ʹ  scene  joke  and  
had  only  developed  further  at  Geoffrey's  insistence.    
Then  some  publishers  became  interested,  and  I  was  commissioned  
by  Pan  Books  in  England  to  write  up  the  series  in  book  form.  After  a  
lot  of  procrastination  and  hiding  and  inventing  excuses  and  having  
baths,  I  managed  to  get  about  two-­‐thirds  of  it  done.  At  this  point  they  
said,  very  pleasantly  and  politely,  that  I  had  already  passed  ten  
deadlines,  so  would  I  please  just  finish  the  page  I  was  on  and  let  them  
have  the  damn  thing.    
Meanwhile,  I  was  busy  trying  to  write  another  series  and  was  also  
writing  and  script  editing  the  TV  series  "Dr.  Who,"  because  while  it  
was  all  very  pleasant  to  have  your  own  radio  series,  especially  one  
that  somebody  had  written  in  to  say  they  had  heard,  it  didn't  exactly  
buy  you  lunch.    
So  that  was  more  or  less  the  situation  when  the  book  The  
Hitchhiker's  Guide  to  the  Galaxy  was  published  in  England  in  
September  1979  and  appeared  on  the  Sunday  Times  mass  market  
best-­‐seller  list  at  number  one  and  just  stayed  there.  Clearly,  
somebody  had  been  listening.    
This  is  where  things  start  getting  complicated,  and  this  is  what  I  
was  asked,  in  writing  this  Introduction,  to  explain.  The  Guide  has  
appeared  in  so  many  forms  ʹ  books,  radio,  a  television  series,  records  
and  soon  to  be  a  major  motion  picture  ʹ  each  time  with  a  different  
story  line  that  even  its  most  acute  followers  have  become  baffled  at  
times.    
Here  then  is  a  breakdown  of  the  different  versions  ʹ  not  including  
the  various  stage  versions,  which  haven't  been  seen  in  the  States  and  
only  complicate  the  matter  further.    
The  radio  series  began  in  England  in  March  1978.  The  first  series  
consisted  of  six  programs,  or  "fits"  as  they  were  called.  Fits  1  thru  6.  
Easy.  Later  that  year,  one  more  episode  was  recorded  and  broadcast,  
commonly  known  as  the  Christmas  episode.  It  contained  no  reference  
of  any  kind  to  Christmas.  It  was  called  the  Christmas  episode  because  
it  was  first  broadcast  on  December  24,  which  is  not  Christmas  Day.  
After  this,  things  began  to  get  increasingly  complicated.    
In  the  fall  of  1979,  the  first  Hitchhiker  book  was  published  in  
England,  called  The  Hitchhiker's  Guide  to  the  Galaxy.  It  was  a  
substantially  expanded  version  of  the  first  four  episodes  of  the  radio  
series,  in  which  some  of  the  characters  behaved  in  entirely  different  
ways  and  others  behaved  in  exactly  the  same  ways  but  for  entirely  
different  reasons,  which  amounts  to  the  same  thing  but  saves  
rewriting  the  dialogue.    
At  roughly  the  same  time  a  double  record  album  was  released,  
which  was,  by  contrast,  a  slightly  contracted  version  of  the  first  four  
episodes  of  the  radio  series.  These  were  not  the  recordings  that  were  
originally  broadcast  but  wholly  new  recordings  of  substantially  the  
same  scripts.  This  was  done  because  we  had  used  music  off  
gramophone  records  as  incidental  music  for  the  series,  which  is  fine  
on  radio,  but  makes  commercial  release  impossible.    
In  January  1980,  five  new  episodes  of  "The  Hitchhiker's  Guide  to  
the  Galaxy"  were  broadcast  on  BBC  Radio,  all  in  one  week,  bringing  
the  total  number  to  twelve  episodes.    
In  the  fall  of  1980,  the  second  Hitchhiker  book  was  published  in  
England,  around  the  same  time  that  Harmony  Books  published  the  
first  book  in  the  United  States.  It  was  a  very  substantially  reworked,  
reedited  and  contracted  version  of  episodes  7,  8,  9,  10,  11,  12,  S  and  6  
(in  that  order)  of  the  radio  series  "The  Hitchhiker's  Guide  to  the  
Galaxy."  In  case  that  seemed  too  straightforward,  the  book  was  called  
The  Restaurant  at  the  End  of  the  Universe,  because  it  included  the  
material  from  radio  episodes  of  "The  Hitchhiker's  Guide  to  the  
Galaxy,"  which  was  set  in  a  restaurant  called  Milliways,  otherwise  
known  as  the  Restaurant  at  the  End  of  the  Universe.    
At  roughly  the  same  time,  a  second  record  album  was  made  
featuring  a  heavily  rewritten  and  expanded  version  of  episodes  5  and  
6  of  the  radio  series.  This  record  album  was  also  called  The  Restaurant  
at  the  End  of  the  Universe.    
Meanwhile,  a  series  of  six  television  episodes  of  "The  Hitchhiker's  
Guide  to  the  Galaxy"  was  made  by  the  BBC  and  broadcast  in  January  
1981.  This  was  based,  more  or  less,  on  the  first  six  episodes  of  the  
radio  series.  In  other  words,  it  incorporated  most  of  the  book  The  
Hitchhiker's  Guide  to  the  Galaxy  and  the  second  half  of  the  book  The  
Restaurant  at  be  End  of  the  Universe.  Therefore,  though  it  followed  
the  basic  structure  of  the  radio  series,  it  incorporated  revisions  from  
the  books,  which  didn't.    
In  January  1982  Harmony  Books  published  The  Restaurant  at  the  
End  of  the  Universe  in  the  United  States.    
In  the  summer  of  1982,  a  third  Hitchhiker  book  was  published  
simultaneously  in  England  and  the  United  States,  called  Life,  the  
Universe  and  Everything.  This  was  not  based  on  anything  that  had  
already  been  heard  or  seen  on  radio  or  television.  In  fact  it  flatly  
contradicted  episodes  7,  8,  9,  10,  I  1  and  12  of  the  radio  series.  These  
episodes  of  "The  Hitchhiker's  Guide  to  the  Galaxy,"  you  will  
remember,  had  already  been  incorporated  in  revised  form  in  the  book  
called  The  Restaurant  at  the  End  of  the  Universe.    
At  this  point  I  went  to  America  to  write  a  film  screenplay  which  was  
completely  inconsistent  with  most  of  what  has  gone  on  so  far,  and  
since  that  film  was  then  delayed  in  the  making  (a  rumor  currently  has  
it  that  filming  will  start  shortly  before  the  Last  Trump),  I  wrote  a  
fourth  and  last  book  in  the  trilogy,  So  Long,  and  Thanks  for  All  the  Fish.  
This  was  published  in  Britain  and  the  USA  in  the  fall  of  1984  and  it  
effectively  contradicted  everything  to  date,  up  to  and  including  itself.    
As  if  this  all  were  not  enough  I  wrote  a  computer  game  for  Infocom  
called  The  Hitchhiker's  Guide  to  the  Galaxy,  which  bore  only  fleeting  
resemblances  to  anything  that  had  previously  gone  under  that  title,  
and  in  collaboration  with  Geoffrey  Perkins  assembled  The  Hitchhiker  s  
Guide  to  the  Galaxy:  The  Original  Radio  Scripts  (published  in  England  
and  the  USA  in  1985).  Now  this  was  an  interesting  venture.  The  book  
is,  as  the  title  suggests,  a  collection  of  all  the  radio  scripts,  as  
broadcast,  and  it  is  therefore  the  only  example  of  one  Hitchhiker  
publication  accurately  and  consistently  reflecting  another.  I  feel  a  
little  uncomfortable  with  this  ʹ  which  is  why  the  introduction  to  that  
book  was  written  after  the  final  and  definitive  one  you  are  now  
reading  and,  of  course,  flatly  contradicts  it.    
People  often  ask  me  how  they  can  leave  the  planet,  so  I  have  
prepared  some  brief  notes.    
  
How  to  Leave  the  Planet    
I.  Phone  NASA.  Their  phone  number  is  (713)  483-­‐3111.  Explain  that  
it's  very  important  that  you  get  away  as  soon  as  possible.    
2.  If  they  do  not  cooperate,  phone  any  friend  you  may  have  in  the  
White  House-­‐(202)  456-­‐1414-­‐to  have  a  word  on  your  behalf  with  the  
guys  at  NASA.    
3.  If  you  don't  have  any  friends  in  the  White  House,  phone  the  
Kremlin  (ask  the  overseas  operator  for  0107-­‐095-­‐295-­‐9051).  They  
don't  have  any  friends  there  either  (at  least,  none  to  speak  of),  but  
they  do  seem  to  have  a  little  influence,  so  you  may  as  well  try.    
4.  If  that  also  fails,  phone  the  Pope  for  guidance.  His  telephone  
number  is  011-­‐39-­‐6-­‐6982,  and  I  gather  his  switchboard  is  infallible.    
5.  If  all  these  attempts  fail,  flag  down  a  passing  flying  saucer  and  
explain  that  de's  vitally  important  you  get  away  before  your  phone  bill  
arrives.
